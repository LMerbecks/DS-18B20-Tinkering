I want to look for a library for the DS 18B20 sensor. There is a library but it needs to be seen wether multiple temperature sensors can be connected to it. 

# Installation

Installation via the platformio library browser.

Okay different approach just use the oneWire directly search for the adress of the sensor then go from there
