# DS-18B20-Tinkering
A project to get to know the DS 18B20 temperature sensor


## Motivation

I recently discovered the digtial temperature sensor market and was fascinated by the complexity built into these extremly tiny devices. Thats why I ordered some and want to get to know them. The opportunity to learn how to use these sensors in a bus configuration opens up new project applications such as simplified data logging. 

## Goals

Read the temperature data of 3 different DS18B20 temperature sensors on one bus. 

## Plan

- [ ] Read temperature data of a single DS18B20 on a bus
- [ ] Read temperature data of mutliple DS18B20 on a bus
